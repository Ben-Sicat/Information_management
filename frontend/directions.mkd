## Contributing Code

Here's the step-by-step process for contributing code to this project:

1. Make sure you are on the `main` branch of the repository by running the following command:

```
git checkout main
```

2. Create a new branch for your feature by running the following command:

```
git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>
```

Replace `<feature-branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your feature branch.

3. Write your code and commit your changes. Make sure you write descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you made. Here's an example:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added login form component"
```

4. Push your changes to the feature branch on GitHub:

```
git push origin <feature-branch-name>
```

5. Open a pull request on GitHub by navigating to the project's repository page and clicking on the "New pull request" button. Select your feature branch as the source branch and the `main` branch as the target branch.

6. Wait for a project maintainer to review your code and provide feedback. Make any necessary changes based on the feedback you receive.

7. Once your pull request is approved, merge your feature branch into the `main` branch by clicking on the "Merge pull request" button on GitHub.
